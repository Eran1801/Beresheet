# Beresheet
In this repository we simulate the landing of the Beresheet spacecraft on the moon using a PID CONTROLLER.

The Beresheet spacecraft was Israel's first attempt at landing on the Moon, and it used a PID controller to help guide its descent onto the lunar surface.

One example of how the PID controller was used in Beresheet's landing is in controlling the spacecraft's throttle during the descent. The PID controller monitored the spacecraft's altitude and velocity, and adjusted the throttle to maintain a steady descent rate and avoid a crash landing.

The proportional (P) component of the PID controller provided an immediate response to any deviations from the desired descent rate, while the integral (I) component helped to eliminate any steady-state errors in the descent rate, and the derivative (D) component helped to dampen any oscillations in the descent rate.

By using the PID controller to control the throttle during descent, the Beresheet spacecraft was able to make a soft landing on the lunar surface, albeit with some technical issues that prevented it from completing its mission fully.
